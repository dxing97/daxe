These test files were written to help me understand Ulfius and libwebsockets (especially libwebsockets). lws-echoclient-annotated.c is a heavily commented version of test-echo.c from libwebsockets' test server code. lws-echoclient-annotated.c compiles, but ulfius-test.c does not work. Note that the echo code will likely need lws compiled from source rather than using the one that ships with your linux distro.
