# Bot 1

This bot gets a gateway URL and connects to it. Attempts to heartbeat.
Bot token is user-specified. Doesn't check if the token is correct.

~~A Discord library written in C, currently in development. 
Don't expect anything in here to work at the moment.~~



## install.sh
Automagically installs dependencies and builds libwebsockets and
ulfius from source. Doesn't actually install libdiscord.

Tested against Ubuntu 17.04 ("Zesty"). More distros will be tested later.
